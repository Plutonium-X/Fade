INSTALLATION

ToB is required, although the mod currently has only SoA content. Extract the contents of the .rar file into your BGII main directory, which is normally

	C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA

Run Setup-Fade.exe to install.


NOTES ON PLAYING FADE

Fade is a chaotic neutral Fey'ri (elven tiefling) Shadow Thief, and is romanceable by males of any race and alignment. This is the SoA portion of the romance - the ToB portion is being written now! 

Fade is only available through Aran Linvail - you will not be able to join Bodhi's Guild and have Fade in the party. If you turn on Aran at any point, she will attack you. Try to get her as early as possible, and take your time with her. Please do not be tempted to accelerate her LTs - if you do, you may miss some important things! Don't be afraid of teasing her and telling her off - just don't outright insult her. 

Please be aware that some of the content of this mod could offend - mature situations are described and sometimes the language can get somewhat colourful.  

This is just the SoA release - ToB release is coming soon.
